# Multi-Step Form with React

## Overview

This project is a responsive multi-step form built with React.js. The form includes three steps:
1. Personal Information
2. Address Information
3. Confirmation

The form validates user input, handles errors, and persists data to local storage.

## Features

- **Multi-step navigation:** Users can navigate through steps with proper validation and error messages.
- **Client-side validation:** Ensures all required fields are filled and valid before moving to the next step.
- **Local storage persistence:** Data is saved to local storage and retrieved if the user revisits the form.
- **Responsive design:** Works well on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
- **Enhanced UX:** Includes animations and transitions between steps (bonus feature).
- **Unit tests:** Critical components and validation functions are tested (bonus feature).
